# Known Issues

1) If the gray areas overlap each other, you might be using Windows10 Scaling option. Simply download this version (will commit later): [IdleonHelper_woScaling.exe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/860959133552738305/861733211050213456/IdleonHelper_woScaling.exe)
2) If you dont see overlay image but you see text "overlay2.png" instead, download the *images.zip* from Download link and unpack to same directory as executable
3) Any other issue? Contact me on discord: se7en#3526
